# Video Compression using Python and FFMPEG

This script uses the FFMPEG library to compress video files. It uses the VP9 codec for video and the Opus codec for audio.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or greater
-   FFMPEG

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the video you want to compress in the same directory as the `Compress.py` script.
3. Open `Compress.py` and modify the `input` and `output` variables to match your input and output file names.
4. Download the FFMPEG library from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
5. Extract the contents and place the `ffmpeg` executable in the same directory as the `Compress.py` script.
6. Execute `ffmpeg.exe` (if you are using Windows).
7. Run the script using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python Compress.py
```
